                Wood, Antony, et al. <i>Best Tall Buildings: a Global Overview of 2013 Skyscrapers: CTBUH Awards.</i> <br />

            </p>

            <p>Summary:</p>
            <p>The chapter in this book "the power and the glory - strength and elegance in structure" specifically focuses <br />
            on the CCTV tower. In particular, it talks about how its form - being one continuous tube system allows for the building <br />
            to withstand the substantial seismic and wind events that it experiences. The source also talks about how the building is <br />
            reinforced with steel beams, arranged in a particular manner. Although undoubtedly providing a structural service, these <br />
            beams also act as a pleasing visual to the rhythm of the building. I also found it interesting that although the 243m tall building <br />
            is within the required height limit, it did not meet standards structurally, and had to be looked at in-depth by a panel of <br />
            Chinese engineers.</p>

            <p>Summary:</p>
            <p>This source has examines thousands of years of the history of architecture. There is a chapter near the end <br />
            focusing on globalization, and China specifically. There are interesting facts here such as the global price <br />
            steel doubling due to demand for Chinese skyscrapers. There is also discussion of Rem Koolhaas' book, <i>S, M, L, XL</i> <br />
            and his musing about the contemporary city with specifics regard to the importance of scale in architecture. The article then <br />
            details some of Koolhaas' most famous works around the world, of course including the CCTV tower in Beijing. Something I found <br />
            particularly enlightening was Koolhaas's view that "the usual differences between architecture, the street, and the city are things <br />
            of the past. Instead, architecture has to embrace and combine all of these.</p>

            <p>Summary:</p>
            <p>
                This source discusses several aspects of the CCTV tower and what it represents for China and its future. There is a <br />
                big emphasis on the transparency it provides, both metaphorically and physically. The building is designed so that anyone can come <br />
                and witness the state-run television being produced, without any secrets. The sources also discusses how this new tower is a <br />
                "rebranding" of sorts for CCTV. The building is also designed in such a way that office workers will be more in-tune with what their <br />
                colleagues are working on, thereby establishing a greater sense of community within the organization through architecture. There is an <br />
                emphasis on the flow of communication between employees that is representative of the flow of information from CCTV itself to the Chinese citizens.
