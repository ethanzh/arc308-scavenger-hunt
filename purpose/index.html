            <p>CCTV is the leading state broadcaster of news media in China. It broadcasts all kinds of different media <br />
            such as documentaries, comedies, and news. Although their first broadcast was in 1958, CCTV was not officially <br />
            launched until 1978. Prior to the construction of the CCTV tower, all of CCTV's operations took place in the <br />
            old China Media Group building, pictured below.</p>

            <img src="old.jpg" alt="old" style="width: 300px"/>

            <p>In 2001, Beijing (and China as a whole) was growing faster than ever before. This meant the state-run media <br />
            was also growing. By 2001, CCTV decided they had outgrown their old building and were in need of a new one <br />
            (details about that process can be found <a href="../video">here</a>). When the building opened in 2016, it was the <br />
            face of a new, more modern China.</p>

            <img src="new.jpg" alt="new" style="width: 450px"/>

            <p>Unsurprisingly, this building's main purpose is to house China Central Television. However, the beauty is in the <br />
            details, and that is exactly what architect Rem Koolhaas took into account.</p>

            <p>The building's two separate towers, the the connector between them all serve different purposes. Tower 1 is where the lobby, editing <br />
            area, and offices are. Tower 1 also descends three floors underground, connecting directly to the Beijing railway <br />
            system. Tower 2 on the other hand is where the actual broadcasting of news takes place. The connector between the two towers, <br />
            dubbed 'The Overhang' is where all administrative work is done.
            </p>

            <p>One might expect the CCTV tower to exclusively be used by office workers employed by CCTV. However it's purpose goes <br />
            far beyond that. Yes, of course the main users of the building are the 10,000 CCTV employees (editors, newscasters, journalists to name a few) <br />
            but the building is also used by thousands of commuters who use the tower's subway stop to get to work. The architects also <br />
            went to great lengths to facilitate public access, wherein visitors can be shown the entirety of the tower, including the history <br />
            of CCTV, sights of everyday studio work, as well the amazing views of the rest of Beijing. Because of this, one could say <br />
            every resident or visitor to Beijing is a potential user of the building. The outdoor areas of the building are also used for filming <br />
            as well as acting as common spaces where employees can relax and interact.</p>

            <p>As one of the first modern buildings in Beijing's central business district, one could make the argument that the <br />
            CCTV tower affected the lives of everyone living in the area, and also drew people in. One personal anecdote I can add, is <br />
            that this area is filled with vendors selling delicious street food (my favorite is a Chinese crepe called 煎饼, pictured below). <br />
            I would count merchants such as these as "users" of the building in the sense that they profit and make a living off of the <br />
            thousands of employees who go in and out of the building everyday.</p>
